      'Place your right arm above your head and a balloon in your left hand.',
      'Inhale through your nose and as you exhale through your mouth, perform a pelvic tilt so that your tailbone is raised slightly off the mat. Keep your low back flat on the mat. Do not press your feet flat into the wall instead dig down with your heels.',
      'Shift your left knee down so that it is below the level of your right without moving your feet and press your left knee into the ball. You should feel your left inner thigh engage.',
      'With your left knee shifted down, take your right foot off the wall. You should feel the back of your left thigh engage. Maintain this position for the remainder of the exercise.',
      'Now inhale through your nose and slowly blow out into the balloon.',
      'Pause three seconds with your tongue on the roof of your mouth to prevent airflow out of the balloon.',
      'Without pinching the neck of the balloon and keeping your tongue on the roof of your mouth, inhale again through your nose.',
      'Slowly blow out as you stabilize the balloon with your hand.',
      'Do not strain your neck or cheeks as you blow.',
      'After the fourth breath in, pinch the balloon neck and remove it from your mouth. Let the air out of the balloon.',
      'Relax and repeat the sequence 4 more times.',
